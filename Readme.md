`Tactics DS` is an example game developed using `FMAW Framework` which is included in this repository. This project is the result of our work for different subjects on video game design and architecture.

## FMAW Framework

`FMAW Framework` is a custom framework built on top of `libnds` and designed to be ported to any platform easily. Currently there is only available an implementation for Nintendo DS.

Files prefixed `fmaw_` are part of the framework.

## Tactics DS

`Tactics DS` is just a demo of the capabilities of `FMAW Framework`. It's inspired on Fire Emblem saga and features single and multiplayer modes. It's not meant to be a commercial product in any way but an academic example of `FMAW Framework usage`.

## Development blog

We wrote a blog during development, which is available on [Github](http://sumolari.github.io/TacticsDS) (only in Spanish).
